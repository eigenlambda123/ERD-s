# ERD-s: Entity Relationship Diagrams for Backend Mastery

**ERD-s** is a focused collection of hand-crafted **Entity-Relationship Diagrams** (ERDs) built to sharpen database modeling skills through deliberate practice.

This project is part of my **Project10X** learning series, where I master backend concepts through structured, project-driven repetition. Each ERD here is tied to a real-world system and serves as both a study artifact and a design reference.

## Purpose

- Develop fluency in designing relational data models.
- Internalize core concepts like 1:N, M:N relationships, normalization, and database constraints.
- Build a library of schema blueprints to use across backend projects.

## üìÅ Structure

Each ERD includes:
- `diagram/`: Hand-drawn or digitally created ERD diagrams (PNG or SVG).
- `schema/`: Optional SQL or Django model equivalents (when applicable).
- `notes.md`: Key decisions and relationship explanations per system.

## Why This Exists

In backend development, strong data modeling is foundational. This repo is my way of deeply mastering the **"data layer"** before writing a single line of code. I revisit these diagrams while building APIs, writing serializers, and designing query logic.

## Tools

- Diagrams made using [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/), pen/paper scans, or [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/)
- Database systems: PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (for small-scale examples)

## Future Plans

- Add version-controlled SQL schemas
- Annotate each diagram with relationships and constraints
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for upcoming backend projects
